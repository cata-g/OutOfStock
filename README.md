<h1>OutOfStock</h1>

<p>A website built in plain PHP, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for a small business selling custom T-shirts. This was my first website, and the goal was to learn PHP while building a functional website. The project took approximately one month to complete.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dynamic display of t-shirts from a database</li>
  <li>Order form to send orders to the business</li>
  <li>Dynamic generated carousel image gallery for each product</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Run</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Clone the repository</li>
  <li>Make sure you have a web server running (such as Apache) and PHP installed</li>
  <li>Import the provided SQL file to set up the database</li>
  <li>Update the config file with your database credentials</li>
  <li>Open the website in your browser</li>
</ol>

<h2>Note</h2>
<ul>
  <li>This is a basic website built as a learning project and may not include all the features that a professional website would have.</li>
  <li>Use it as a reference for learning or for a small business with similar requirements</li>
</ul>
